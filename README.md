# Movie Genre Classification from Images using Convolutional Neural Network
 In this module I used a Convolutional Neural Network and trained it on around 8000 Image covers to classify which genre the movie belonged to just from the picture provided.
 
Github had truncated the dataset to 1000 images so 6,867 entries were omitted from the list.
Please email me if you want the full dataset. 

The Images are labeled in train.csv file. 
Happy Coding!
